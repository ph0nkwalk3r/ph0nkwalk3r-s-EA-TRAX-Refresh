## ph0nkwalk3r’s EA TRAX™ Refresh

## 1. Introduction

**Need for Speed™ Most Wanted (2005)** is an iconic title within the Need for Speed community, and its soundtrack played a major role in shaping the overall experience.  
For many players — including myself — **EA TRAX** was a gateway to discovering new music.

While the original soundtrack remains iconic, over time it began to feel dated in the context of modern gameplay and heavily modded experiences.  
This project was created to provide a **fresh audio identity**, while preserving the spirit and energy that made EA TRAX memorable in the first place.
